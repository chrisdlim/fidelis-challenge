# FidelisChallenge

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.17.

## From Chris: 
I've zipped this up without the node_modules fyi so don't forget to run `npm i`!
I've also manually updated the port in the package.json to serve this on port 4201
## Development server

Run `npm run start` and navigate to http://localhost:4201
